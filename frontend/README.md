Perfect ‚Äî you‚Äôre building something ambitious and collaborative, so your **README** should do three things:

1. Explain the *what* and *why* (so anyone landing on it instantly gets the purpose).
2. Show how to *run and contribute* without chaos.
3. Look professional and future-proof for recruiters, professors, or dev teammates.

Here‚Äôs a clean, modern README template written exactly for your setup (`traffic-violation` with frontend, backend, and ML teams).
It‚Äôs copy-paste ready for your repo‚Äôs root directory (`traffic-violation/README.md`).

# üö¶ Traffic Violation Detection & Management System

An integrated platform to detect, record, and manage **traffic violations** using **Machine Learning**, **Computer Vision**, and a **React-based web interface**.

This project aims to automate traffic law enforcement by combining an intuitive frontend dashboard, a scalable backend API, and machine learning models capable of identifying rule violations in real time.

---

## üß© Project Architecture

```

traffic-violation/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ frontend/   # React + Vite web app (user and admin dashboards)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ backend/    # Node.js / Express backend (API, authentication, DB)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ml/         # Python ML models (detection, recognition, automation)

````

Each module is developed and maintained by a dedicated sub-team.

---

## ‚ú® Features

- **Frontend (React + Vite)**
  - User-friendly dashboard to view and pay violations.
  - Admin panel to manage users and verify cases.
  - Real-time data visualization using REST APIs.

- **Backend (Node.js / Express / MongoDB)**
  - RESTful API endpoints for user, violation, and payment management.
  - Secure authentication and role-based access control.
  - Integration with ML module for automatic case creation.

- **ML (Python)**
  - License plate detection and recognition.
  - Violation identification using image/video input.
  - Automated report generation for backend API.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

| Layer      | Technologies Used |
|-------------|------------------|
| Frontend | React, Vite, Tailwind CSS / CSS Modules, Axios, React Router |
| Backend | Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB (Mongoose), JWT Auth |
| Machine Learning | Python, OpenCV, TensorFlow / PyTorch, NumPy, Pandas |
| Tools | Git, GitHub, VSCode, Postman, DVC (for model/data versioning) |

---

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/traffic-violation.git
cd traffic-violation
````

---

### 2. Frontend Setup

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open the displayed URL (e.g., `http://localhost:5173`).

---

### 3. Backend Setup

```bash
cd ../backend
npm install
npm run dev
```

> Configure your environment variables in a `.env` file:
>
> ```env
> MONGO_URI=<your-mongodb-uri>
> JWT_SECRET=<your-jwt-secret>
> PORT=5000
> ```

---

### 4. ML Module Setup

```bash
cd ../ml
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # (Linux/Mac)
venv\Scripts\activate     # (Windows)
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To run a detection test:

```bash
python main.py
```

## üß≠ Branching Workflow

This project uses a **feature-branch workflow** to prevent merge conflicts.

**Main branches:**

* `main` ‚Äî stable, production-ready code.
* `develop` ‚Äî integration branch for ongoing work.

**Feature branches:**

* `feature/frontend/<desc>` ‚Äî frontend tasks
* `feature/backend/<desc>` ‚Äî backend tasks
* `feature/ml/<desc>` ‚Äî ML development

Basic commands:

```bash
# create a new feature branch
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git checkout -b feature/backend/auth-module

# after work
git add .
git commit -m "backend(auth): added JWT login"
git push -u origin feature/backend/auth-module
```

Pull Requests (PRs) should always target `develop`, and require review before merging.

---

## üß† ML Data & Model Management

Large datasets and model checkpoints are **not stored in Git**.
They are managed using:

* **Git LFS** for moderate-size binary files.
* **DVC (Data Version Control)** or **cloud storage (S3/Drive)** for datasets and models.

Example:

```bash
git lfs track "*.pt" "models/*"
git add .gitattributes
git commit -m "chore: track ML models via LFS"
```

---

## ü§ù Contribution Guidelines

1. Fork the repo & clone your fork.
2. Create a feature branch following the naming conventions.
3. Commit changes using conventional messages:

   ```
   feat(frontend): add user dashboard
   fix(backend): correct 500 error on login
   chore(ml): update preprocessing script
   ```
4. Push and open a pull request to `develop`.
5. Ensure all checks (lint/tests) pass before merge.

---

## üß™ Testing

### Frontend

```bash
npm run test
```

### Backend

```bash
npm test
```

### ML

```bash
pytest
```

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Environment Variables

Each folder has its own `.env` file.
Do **not** commit them ‚Äî add `.env` to `.gitignore`.

Example for backend:

```env
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://...
JWT_SECRET=mysecretkey
```

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è CI/CD & Deployment (future scope)

* **Frontend:** Netlify / Vercel
* **Backend:** Render / Railway / AWS EC2
* **ML Model Serving:** FastAPI or Flask microservice on same server
* **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions (lint, test, deploy)
* **Containerization:** Docker Compose to link all modules

### üîß Optional Add-Ons
You can drop the following files into the repo for completeness:
- `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` ‚Äî guides contributors on what to include.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` ‚Äî summarizes your branching and PR rules.
- `CODEOWNERS` ‚Äî auto-assign reviewers by folder.

---

Do you want me to generate those three files (`CONTRIBUTING.md`, `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`, and `CODEOWNERS`) next so your GitHub repo looks fully professional and team-ready?
